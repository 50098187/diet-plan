# Woolworths Partnership Proposal Template

## Subject: Partnership Proposal - Diet Optimization Application

Dear Woolworths Business Development Team,

I am developing a web application that helps South Africans plan nutritious, cost-effective meal plans through mathematical optimization. The application calculates personalized calorie requirements and suggests optimal food combinations based on:

- Individual health metrics (age, weight, height, activity level)
- Nutritional requirements (protein, carbs, fats, fiber)
- Budget constraints
- Food availability

**Why This Benefits Woolworths:**
- Drives customers to purchase healthy foods from Woolworths
- Promotes your fresh produce and quality products
- Positions Woolworths as a partner in healthy living
- Increases basket size through optimized shopping lists

**What I Need:**
Access to accurate product pricing data for approximately 20-30 core food items (eggs, chicken, vegetables, grains, etc.) through:
- Weekly/daily price data feed (CSV, JSON, or API)
- Product information and availability
- Proper attribution and linking back to Woolworths

**What I Offer:**
- Prominent "Powered by Woolworths" branding
- Direct links to Woolworths online shopping
- Free promotion of Woolworths as the preferred healthy food retailer
- Analytics on customer food preferences and demand

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this partnership further.

Best regards,
